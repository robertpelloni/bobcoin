# Bobcoin Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation & Documentation (Current)
- [x] Initialize repository
- [ ] Establish documentation standards (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md)
- [x] Define project structure and architecture
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines

## Phase 2: Core Architecture Design
- [ ] Implement "Rhythm" Consensus (PoS + PoD)
    - [ ] Define slot/epoch structure
    - [ ] Implement VDF for leader selection
- [ ] Develop "Groove" Validation Algorithm
    - [ ] Train ML model for dance verification (Liveness, Humanity, Uniqueness)
    - [ ] Define "DancePacket" structure and serialization
- [ ] Design Privacy Layer
    - [ ] Implement CLSAG Ring Signatures
    - [ ] Implement Bulletproofs+ for RingCT
- [ ] Select technology stack (Language, Frameworks)

## Phase 3: Prototype Implementation
- [ ] Implement Validator Node (Rust/Go)
- [ ] Implement Mobile "Dancer" Client (React Native/Flutter)
    - [ ] Integrate TEE/TrustZone for sensor data signing
- [ ] Implement Storage Node
- [ ] Internal testingnet launch

## Phase 4: Testing & Security
- [ ] Comprehensive unit and integration testing
- [ ] Security audit of consensus logic and crypto primitives
- [ ] Stress testing network capabilities (TPS benchmarks)

## Phase 5: Public Launch
- [ ] Mainnet launch
- [ ] Release official wallet apps
- [ ] Community building and governance setup
